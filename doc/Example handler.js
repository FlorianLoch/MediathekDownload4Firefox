/*
	THIS IS A REFERENCE FILE FOR ADDING FURTHER MEDIATHEK-HANDLERS BESIDE THE ZDFHANDLER
	THE HANDLER SHOULD BE LOCATED IN lib/MediathekHandler-DIRECTORY.	

	Each handler need to be added to the MediathekCore-instance at initialization
	
	Also each handler needs to have an icon in the data/mediathekIcons-directory which can be
	shown as part of the widgets content (beside the name of the mediathek, or being more precise the name of the channel).
	The icon therefore has to be named like this: name is the result of a this.getNameOfChannel()-call
	name.png
